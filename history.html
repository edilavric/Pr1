          <strong><em>Football</em></strong> (or soccer as the game is called in
          some parts of the world) has a long history. Football in its current
          form arose in England in the middle of the
          <strong>19th</strong> century. But alternative versions of the game
          existed much earlier and are a part of the football history. The first
          known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of
          a rock, occurred in old <em>Mesoamerican</em> cultures for over
          <strong>3000</strong>
          years ago. The first known ball game which also involved kicking took
          place In China in the 3rd and 2nd century BC under the name
          <em>Cuju</em>.<em>Cuju</em>
          was played with a round ball (stitched leather with fur or feathers
          inside) on an area of a square.

          The standardization that had been reached in <strong>1863</strong> was
          still far from the modern game we are now familiar with. Here are some
          rules that applied:
        </p>
        <ul style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; color: whitesmoke">
          <li>
            No crossbar was used and the goal was not specific to a limited
            height.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player did catch a high ball, he was rewarded a free kick.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the ball crossed the sideline, the player that first got the ball
            was rewarded the throw-in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Throw-ins was made with one hand (this was not practiced in Scotland
            though).

              The referee
            </header>
            No <em>referees</em> were actually involved until
            <strong>1871</strong>. Instead, the captains of both teams were
            assigned to keep order. It was a gentleman's sport.

              The goalkeeper
            </header>
            In the early days, <em>goalkeeper</em> was not a distinctive
            position. Not until <strong>1909</strong> did the last man in the
            team start to wear a different colored shirt. Three years later came
            the rule that dictated that the goalkeeper was only allowed to touch
            the balls with his hand inside the box close to his own goal.

              Corners
            </header>
            <em>Corner-kicks</em> were introduced in <strong>1872</strong>. In
            <strong>1924</strong>, it was decided that a corner-kick was allowed
            to go straight into the goal.

              Penalties
            </header>
            <em>Penalties</em> were introduced in <strong>1891</strong>, before
            that the closest to a penalty was the indirect free kick.a penalty
            was given if the referee judged that a related rule offence had been
            made within twelve yards from the goal line.

              Offside
            </header>
            During the past century, many various forms of the
            <em>offside</em> rules have existed. Since the game in one of its
            earliest forms only included dribbling and not passing at all, an
            offside rule was originally superfluous.The changes of the offside
            rules would initially result in more goals, but in the long run it
            changed the game tactically in a way that more defenders being used.
