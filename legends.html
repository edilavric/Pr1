          take the winning penalty in the 1976 European Championship final, he
          did the unthinkable: struck the ball softly and watched it loop calmly
          into the net. The Czechoslovakia international had done what no other
          had on the international footballing stage, and that "style" of
          penalty has since been dubbed the "Panenka penalty."
